Disease - Predection
A Disease Prediction System is a healthcare application that leverages data science and machine learning to forecast the likelihood of a person developing a particular disease based on historical and real-time health data. This system analyzes input parameters such as age, gender, symptoms, family history, vital signs, and diagnostic results to identify patterns associated with specific diseases.

Using machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Deep Learning (e.g., Neural Networks), the system learns from past medical records and predicts whether a patient is at risk for conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or other chronic illnesses. The goal is to support early detection and enable timely medical intervention, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare professionals.

Such systems can be deployed as web or mobile applications and integrated with electronic health record (EHR) systems to provide real-time decision support for doctors and patients. Besides improving diagnostic accuracy, disease prediction systems can reduce healthcare costs and mortality rates by focusing on prevention and early treatment.
